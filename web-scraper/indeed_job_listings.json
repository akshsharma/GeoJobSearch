Il est possible que les études à l’étranger soient reconnues.\nServir dans la Force de réserve\nCe poste est offert à temps partiel auprès de la Première réserve à certains endroits au Canada. En règle générale, les membres de la Force de réserve servent à temps partiel au sein d’une unité militaire dans leur communauté et peuvent effectuer leur service pendant qu’ils sont aux études ou qu’ils occupent un emploi civil. Ils sont payés durant leur instruction. Ils ne sont pas assujettis aux affectations ni aux déménagements militaires. Toutefois, ils peuvent se porter volontaires pour déménager à une autre base ou pour être affectés au Canada ou à l’étranger dans le cadre de missions militaires.\nInstruction de la Force de réserve\nLes membres de la Force de réserve reçoivent le même niveau d’instruction que leurs homologues de la Force régulière. Ils commencent généralement leur instruction avec leur unité d’appartenance pour s’assurer qu’ils répondent aux normes militaires professionnelles de base. Après l’instruction de base, les soldats d’infanterie reçoivent ensuite l’instruction de l’infanterie d’une durée de 7 semaines à l’un des trois centres d’instruction des FAC. Un salaire concurrentiel est versé tout au long de l’instruction entièrement payée.\nMilieu de travail de la Force de réserve\nEn règle générale, les membres de la Force de réserve effectuent leur service à temps partiel au sein de leur unité d’appartenance, le soir et la fin de semaine, suivant un horaire établi. Toutefois, ils peuvent également effectuer leur service en occupant des postes à temps plein au sein de certaines unités pour des périodes déterminées, selon la nature des tâches à exécuter. Ils reçoivent 92,8 % du taux de rémunération de la Force régulière, ont droit à des avantages sociaux raisonnables et peuvent être admissibles à contribuer à un régime de pension.\nEnrôlez-vous dans les FAC\nPour en savoir davantage sur le métier de soldat(e) d’infanterie dans la Réserve de l’Armée, visitez le site https://forces.ca/fr/carriere/fantassin/.\nDécouvrez plus de 100 autres possibilités de carrière à www.forces.ca/fr/carrieres.\nType d'emploi : Temps partiel"

Cette instruction fournit les compétences de base et les connaissances communes à tous les groupes professionnels. L’un des objectifs du cours est de veiller à ce que toutes les recrues répondent à la norme d’aptitude physique des Forces armées canadiennes (FAC); l’entraînement est donc exigeant sur le plan physique.\nQualification militaire de base – Terre\nAprès l’instruction de base, les recrues de l’Armée doivent se rendre à un centre d’entraînement militaire pour suivre le cours de qualification militaire de base – Terre.

Un salaire concurrentiel est versé tout au long de l’instruction entièrement payée.\nMilieu de travail de la Force de réserve\nEn règle générale, les membres de la Force de réserve effectuent leur service à temps partiel au sein de leur unité d’appartenance, le soir et la fin de semaine, suivant un horaire établi. Toutefois, ils peuvent également effectuer leur service en occupant des postes à temps plein au sein de certaines unités pour des périodes déterminées, selon la nature des tâches à exécuter.
