# We made a mistake!

We accidentally created a second branch where there should only be one. I'm kinda scared to delete stuff on gitlab, so we decided to just leave it where it is and ignore it. Hopefully this is fine.

# CIS*3760 Project Template

This project will serve as a guide on how to setup a three part application that includes a Spring server, a SQL database and a React frontend both locally and on a Kubernetes host.

## Local Setup

To setup the project locally, you must have [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running on your machine. Once it is setup, run the following command:

```
docker compose up
```

This will setup the app and you can access the following addresses on your browser:
- React frontend = http://localhost:3000
- Spring backend = http://localhost:8080/api (add **/docs.html** to access Swagger UI)
